# Detect Fake News
Use three vectorization methods (document frequency, TF-IDF within the Bag-of-Words models, and Word2Vec within the Word Embedding models) and four different machine learning models (Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Feedforward Neural Network) to form 12 kinds of classification methods.  

Achieve the best accuracy rate of 93.7%.
